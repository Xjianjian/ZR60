N * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
N * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
N * application code.
N *
N * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
N * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
N * descending item value order.
N *
N * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
N * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
N * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
N * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
N * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
N * the list.
N *
N * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
N * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
N * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
N * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
N * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
N * the list item itself.

N * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
N * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
N * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
N * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
N * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
N * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
N * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
N * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
N * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
N * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
N * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
N * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
N * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
N * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
N * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
N * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
N * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
N * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
N * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
N * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
N * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below

N    /*
N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N *
N * Creates a new software timer instance.  This allocates the storage required
N * by the new timer, initialises the new timers internal state, and returns a
N * handle by which the new timer can be referenced.
N *
N * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
N * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
N * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
N * timer into the active state.
N *
N * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
N * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
N * by its handle, and never by its name.
N *
N * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
N * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
N * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
N * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
N * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
N * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
N * equal to 1000.
N *
N * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
N * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
N * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
N * enter the dormant state after it expires.
N *
N * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
N * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
N * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
N * timer.
N *
N * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
N * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,

N *                                          BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
N *
N *
N * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
N * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
N * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
N *
N * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
N * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
N * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
N * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
N * to the RTOS daemon task.
N *
N * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
N * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
N * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
N * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
N *
N * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
N * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
N * prototype.
N *
N * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
N * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
N * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
N * used to point to a structure.
N *
N * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
N *
N * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
N * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
N * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
N * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
N * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
N * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
N * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
N * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
N * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
N * example code below.
N *
N * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
N * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
N *
N * Example usage:
N * @verbatim
N *
N *	// The callback function that will execute in the context of the daemon task.
N *  // Note callback functions must all use this same prototype.
N *  void vProcessInterface( void *pvParameter1, uint32_t ulParameter2 )
N *	{
N *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService;
N *
N *		// The interface that requires servicing is passed in the second
N *      // parameter.  The first parameter is not used in this case.
N *		xInterfaceToService = ( BaseType_t ) ulParameter2;
N *
N *		// ...Perform the processing here...
N *	}
N *
N *	// An ISR that receives data packets from multiple interfaces
N *  void vAnISR( void )
N *	{
N *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService, xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;
N *
N *		// Query the hardware to determine which interface needs processing.
N *		xInterfaceToService = prvCheckInterfaces();
N *
N *      // The actual processing is to be deferred to a task.  Request the
N *      // vProcessInterface() callback function is executed, passing in the
N *		// number of the interface that needs processing.  The interface to
N *		// service is passed in the second parameter.  The first parameter is
N *		// not used in this case.
N *		xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
N *		xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR( vProcessInterface, NULL, ( uint32_t ) xInterfaceToService, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
N *
N *		// If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is now set to pdTRUE then a context
N *		// switch should be requested.  The macro used is port specific and will
N *		// be either portYIELD_FROM_ISR() or portEND_SWITCHING_ISR() - refer to

N/**
N * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
N * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
N * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
N * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
N * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
N * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
N * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
N * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
N * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
N * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
N * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
N * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
N * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
N * send a SYNC).
N *
N * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
N * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
N * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
N * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
N * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are

N * configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS is 1 then each event group contains 8 usable bits (bit
N * 0 to bit 7).  If configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS is set to 0 then each event group has
N * 24 usable bits (bit 0 to bit 23).  The EventBits_t type is used to store
N * event bits within an event group.
N *
N * @return If the event group was created then a handle to the event group is
N * returned.  If there was insufficient FreeRTOS heap available to create the
N * event group then NULL is returned.  See http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html
